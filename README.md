Recently I have learned the HTML & CSS and I tried my 1st webpage.
Here, i have used 3 css sheets, 
1.style.css which contain all of my styling commands.
2.utils.css which contain all the reuseable styling commands.
3.responsive.css which contain all the commands to make my page responsive.
You all are welcome to push any upgrade just use different branch.
